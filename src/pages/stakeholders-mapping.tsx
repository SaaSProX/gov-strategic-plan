          Stakeholder mapping is the process of identifying and categorizing key
          stakeholders involved in achieving the policy objectives and goals of
          the House Committee on Commerce. It entails developing a stakeholder's
          map, build the list of relevant stakeholders from this map,
          determining the level of involvement of each stakeholder, their
          purpose, area of interest and goals and building an engagement plan
          for their smooth contribution to the achievement of the statutory
          mandate.
